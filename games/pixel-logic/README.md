# Pixel Logic

A small browser game written in plain JavaScript (no libraries, no build step).

## Run it

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or drag it into Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari).

That's it, no install or server needed. If you prefer a local server:

```
npx serve .
```

## How to play

- **Goal:** Find the hidden picture by filling in the right squares.
- **Clues:** The numbers by each row and column are the runs of filled squares in that line, in order. "3 1" means 3 filled, a gap, then 1 more.
- **Tap:** Tap a square to fill it. Switch to ❌ mode to mark squares you know are empty.
- **Keys:** Arrows to move, space to fill, X to mark.
- **Levels:** Pictures get bigger as you solve them, from 5 × 5 up to 8 × 8.

Press **↺ Restart** under the game screen to start over.
