# Rock Paper Scissors · vs bot

A small browser game written in plain JavaScript (no libraries, no build step).

## Run it

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or drag it into Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari).

That's it, no install or server needed. If you prefer a local server:

```
npx serve .
```

## How to play

- **Goal:** Beat the bot to 10 wins. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.
- **Controls:** Tap a hand, or press `R` `P` `S` (or `1` `2` `3`).
- **The bot:** It remembers what you usually play after each hand, and plays whatever beats its guess. It tells you what it guessed.
- **Tip:** Humans fall into patterns. Try to be random, or set a trap and switch it up.
- **Rematch:** Tap after a match. The bot keeps its memory of you.

Press **↺ Restart** under the game screen to start over.
