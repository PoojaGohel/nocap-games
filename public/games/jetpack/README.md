# Jetpack

A small browser game written in plain JavaScript (no libraries, no build step).

## Run it

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or drag it into Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari).

That's it, no install or server needed. If you prefer a local server:

```
npx serve .
```

## How to play

- **Goal:** Fly as far as you can and grab 🪙 coins. Each coin is worth 10 points.
- **Controls:** Hold `space` or `↑` (or hold the screen) to fly up. Let go to fall.
- **Zappers:** The ⚡ yellow laser bars come in different angles. Touching one ends the run.
- **Missiles:** ⚠️ means a 🚀 missile is locking on to your height. Move away before it fires!

Press **↺ Restart** under the game screen to start over.
